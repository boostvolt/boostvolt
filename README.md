When I'm not completely immersed in the FanScore universe (which is most of the time, let's be honest! ðŸ˜…), I also wear a couple of other hats:

ðŸ”­ As Technical Lead at [St.Galler Kantonalbank](https://github.com/stgallerkb), I'm focused on boosting developer productivity and streamlining software delivery by spearheading a unified Internal Developer Platform (IDP) and optimizing the full Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC).

ðŸ’¸ And as an Investment Analyst at [S2S Ventures](https://github.com/s2s-ventures), I help kickstart bold Swiss student ventures with their first check (up to CHF 25k).
