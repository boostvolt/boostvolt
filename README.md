### Hello there! 👋 

I'm Jan Kott, also known as `@boostvolt` based in Switzerland.

🚀 Co-founder of [FanScore](https://github.com/fanscore-ch)!  
We're building a next-generation sports engagement platform that unifies the entire fan experience. Our ecosystem spans a gamification engine, social hub, digital collectibles marketplace, and direct commerce pipeline – all powered by real-time sports data.  

💻 Here’s a look at the stack we’re building on:  
  - **Go (Ent, OpenFGA)** for our high-performance backend and data layer  
  - **NATS, Watermill, RiverQueue** for real-time messaging and job processing  
  - **TypeScript, Expo, Relay, Tamagui** for sleek, cross-platform web & mobile experiences  

...and much more.

When I'm not completely immersed in the FanScore universe (which is most of the time, let’s be honest! 😅), I also wear a couple of other hats:

🔭 As Technical Lead at [St.Galler Kantonalbank](https://github.com/stgallerkb), I'm focused on boosting developer productivity and streamlining software delivery by spearheading a unified Internal Developer Platform (IDP) and optimizing the full Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC).

💸 As Investor & Partner at [S2S Ventures](https://github.com/s2s-ventures), I support bold student founders with their first checks (up to CHF 25k), evaluate early-stage startups, and help scale fund operations with strategic and operational leadership.
